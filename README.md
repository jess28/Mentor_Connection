# Mentor Connection
This is code from the website made during [Uconn's Mentor Connection](http://mentor.education.uconn.edu/) in 2014. This program places high school juniors and seniors with University labs and studios of their choice. They then spend six weeks learning from University professors and/or graduate students about their field of choice and complete a project to present at the end of the program. This program provides the students with experience in more professional roles in their field of interest.

Unfortunately the website was never released, but this repo includes both the final code and an intermediate stage of code. All of this projects uses GoogleScript for the language which allows integration with [Google Sites](https://apps.google.com/intx/en_us/products/sites/).

## So what is this for?
We wanted to create a search engine to easily connect frog and human gene orthologs. This would allow researchers to discover ways that the disease or gene they are interested in in humans could be modeled in a frog, rather than the usual mouse.

## Some things to note
We used GoogleScript's ability to easily connect with Google Sheets to create a database of results.

The search functions we created all have a fuzzy search implementation to allow for small spelling mistakes.
